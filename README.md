# Zenburn for BBEdit

This is an adaptation of Jani Nurminenâ€™s [Zenburn](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/) color scheme for BBEdit. It looks best in when dark mode is enabled in macOS.

## Installation

Place the `Zenburn.bbColorScheme` in `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Color Schemes` directory.
